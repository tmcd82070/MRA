\title{ print.nhat }
\description{
  Print the estimates of N from a CJS object in a nice format.
}
\usage{ 
\method{print}{nhat}(x, width=10, ...)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{An object of class "nhat", which inherits from class "cr".  This class of object is 
              output from \code{F.cr.model.avg}. }
  \item{width}{The minimum width of columns in the table printed by this routine.} 
  \item{...}{Arguments to other functions called by this one. Currently no other 
		functions are called, so this is not used, but must be here 
		for compatibility with the generic \code{print} function.
	    }
}
\details{
Horvitz-Thompson estimates of N, along with 
standard errors, are printed.  \code{print.cjs} also prints N estimates, if present, 
but as a brief, one-row summary.  This routine prints a more complete table.  Numerical 
values of the \code{supsmu} smooth of N estimates (\code{bass} = 0.5) associated with 
plots produced by \code{plot.cjs} are printed.

\value{ Nothing.  Run for side effects }
